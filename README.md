# Description
Unfortunately, you've pushed a button. In 20 seconds, the rocket will be launched, and many parameters are still un-okey ! Your only way to avoid explosion, and to repair the rocket, is your control console. Unfortunately, you don't know the functions of every button ! If the rocket explode, you will return to the beginning. You are stuck in a time-loop of 20 seconds, as long as you don't repair the rocket. Controls are very simple. Click on the buttons to... Do something ! And if you don't have the patience to wait 20 seconds to lose, you can always push "P" to restart. Good luck ! And, as we say in France "Bon appÃ©tit".
